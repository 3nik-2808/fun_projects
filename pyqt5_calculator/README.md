## Introduction

This is a virtual calculator whose inspiration is taken from CASIO scientific calculator, using PyQt5. The graphical code is auto-generated Qt Designer (a package that allows us to directly edit the app's GUI) in PyQt.

The calculator includes these functionalities:
- Basic mathematic operations (plus, minus, multiply, divide).
- Trigonometric functions.
- Logarithm function and exponential operators.
- Variables for value storage.
- Integration and derivative (value-only results).
- Complex number mathematics.
- Polynomial equations solving.
- Factorial calculation.
- Prime factors decomposition.
- Absolute value.
- Sum (sigma) function.

## Instruction

- Please run this with Python 3.8 and up.
- Before running, please install all of the library used in the code, including PyQt5, math, numpy, matplotlib, cmath and scipy.
- If you want to create .exe file for the app, I recommend using auto-py-to-exe package.
